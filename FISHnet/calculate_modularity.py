"""
This module uses the  louvain algorithm to calculate modularity
Input:
A: a square symmetric matrix of 5C counts data that does not contain NaNs
P: a square symmetric matrix with the same dimensions as A that serves as the null model matrix
resolution: structural resolution parameter used to assign communities within the louvain algorithm
seed: an integer seed used to set the random state of the louvain algorithm
Output:
Q, a scalar value of the modularity of the network at the given structural resolution parameter
